# Wallet Banking App - Backend Functionality Logic

## 1. User Registration

1. Create a `UserController` with an endpoint for user registration.
2. In `UserService`:
   - Validate input data (email format, password strength, etc.).
   - Check if the user already exists in the database.
   - Hash the password using BCrypt.
   - Create a new `User` object and save it to MongoDB using `UserRepository`.
   - Generate a JWT token for the new user.
   - Return the user details and token.

## 2. User Login

1. Create an endpoint for user login in `UserController`.
2. In `UserService`:
   - Find the user by email using `UserRepository`.
   - Verify the password using BCrypt.
   - If credentials are valid, generate a new JWT token.
   - Return the user details and token.

## 3. Wallet Recharge

1. Create an endpoint for wallet recharge in `WalletController`.
2. In `WalletService`:
   - Validate the recharge amount (must be positive).
   - Retrieve the user's wallet from `WalletRepository`.
   - Update the wallet balance by adding the recharge amount.
   - Create a new `Transaction` object for the recharge.
   - Save the updated wallet and new transaction to MongoDB.
   - If cashback feature is enabled, calculate and add cashback.
   - Return the updated wallet balance and transaction details.

## 4. Wallet Transfer

1. Create an endpoint for wallet transfer in `WalletController`.
2. In `WalletService`:
   - Validate the transfer amount and recipient.
   - Retrieve sender's and recipient's wallets from `WalletRepository`.
   - Check if sender has sufficient balance.
   - Use a database transaction to ensure atomicity:
     - Deduct amount from sender's wallet.
     - Add amount to recipient's wallet.
     - Create `Transaction` objects for both sender and recipient.
   - Save updated wallets and new transactions to MongoDB.
   - Return updated wallet balances and transaction details.

## 5. View Account Statement

1. Create an endpoint for viewing account statements in `WalletController`.
2. In `WalletService`:
   - Retrieve the user's transactions from `TransactionRepository`.
   - Implement pagination to limit the number of transactions returned.
   - Allow filtering by date range and transaction type.
   - Return a paginated list of transactions.

## 6. User Logout

1. Create an endpoint for user logout in `UserController`.
2. In `UserService`:
   - Invalidate the user's JWT token (add to a blacklist or use short-lived tokens).
   - Clear any server-side sessions (if applicable).
   - Return a success message.

## 7. Cashbacks (Optional)

1. Create a `CashbackController` with endpoints to view and manage cashbacks.
2. In `CashbackService`:
   - Implement logic to calculate cashback based on recharge amount.
   - Create and save `Cashback` objects to MongoDB.
   - Provide methods to retrieve a user's cashback history.

## 8. Email Notifications (Optional)

1. Create an `EmailService` to handle email sending.
2. Use Spring's `JavaMailSender` to send emails.
3. Implement methods for different types of notifications:
   - Welcome email after registration
   - Transaction confirmation emails
   - Cashback received notifications

## Security Considerations

1. Implement JWT authentication for all protected endpoints.
2. Use Spring Security to configure security rules and JWT validation.
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs.
4. Use HTTPS for all communications.
5. Implement proper error handling and logging.

## Concurrency Handling

1. Use optimistic locking with MongoDB to handle concurrent wallet updates.
2. Implement retry mechanisms for transactions in case of conflicts.
3. Use distributed locks for critical operations if needed.

## Testing

1. Write unit tests for all service methods.
2. Implement integration tests for controllers using MockMvc.
3. Use an in-memory MongoDB for testing to ensure isolation.
4. Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
